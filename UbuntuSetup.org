* Scheenshot & Record
** Take Screenshot
Quickly take a screenshot of the desktop, a window, or an area at any time using these global keyboard shortcuts:

- ~Prt Scrn~ to take a screenshot of the desktop.

- ~Alt+Prt Scrn~ to take a screenshot of a window.

- ~Shift+Prt Scrn~ to take a screenshot of an area you select.

When you use a keyboard shortcut, the image is automatically saved in your Pictures folder in your home folder with a file name that begins with Screenshot and includes the date and time it was taken.

You can also hold down ~Ctrl~ with any of the above shortcuts to copy the screenshot image to the clipboard instead of saving it.

** Record Screen
You can make a video recording of what is happening on your screen:

1. Press ~Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R~ to start recording what is on your screen.
   A red circle is displayed in the top right corner of the screen when the recording is in progress.

2. Once you have finished, press ~Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R~ again to stop the recording.

3. The video is automatically saved in your Videos folder in your home folder, with a file name that starts with Screencast and includes the date and time it was taken.
